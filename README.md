# HasChor

HasChor is a library for functional choreographic programming in Haskell.

- HasChor provides a monadic interface for choreographic programming where
choreographies are expressed as computations in a monad.

- Based on Haskell's type system, HasChor supports *higher-order choreographies*
and *location polymorphism*, both features that enable modularity and code
reuse.

- HasChor's implementation is flexible, extensible, and concise (less than 300
lines of code) thanks to the mixed embedding technique it usesâ€”freer monads,
which allows it to reuse existing Haskell constructs as much as possible while
interpreting choreographic primitives freely.

See our [ICFP 2023 paper (preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00924) for more deatils.
For API specifications, check out the [documentation](https://gshen42.github.io/HasChor/).

HasChor's design is heavily influenced by [Pirouette](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3498684).
For a general introduction to choreographic programming, we recommend
[Fabrizio Montesi](https://www.fabriziomontesi.com)'s excellent book:
[Introduction to Choreographies](https://www.fabriziomontesi.com/introduction-to-choreographies/).

## Getting started

HasChor is a Haskell library and built with the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC).
The first thing to do is to build HasChor; you can either [build from the source](#building-from-the-source)
or [use the Docker image](#using-the-docker-image).
After successfully building HasChor, you can run example choreographies or write your own choreography.

### Building from the source

HasChor is tested with the following Haskell environment:

- [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) (9.2.6)

- [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) (3.6.2.0)

We recommend using [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) to set up the environment.

To build HasChor, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gshen42/HasChor.git
cd HasChor
cabal build -j20
```

### Using the Docker image

First, clone the repo and build the Docker image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gshen42/HasChor.git
cd HasChor
docker build -t haschor .
```

Next, create a container and run Bash in it:

```bash
docker run -it -name foo haschor bash
```

You should be presented with HasChor's root directory with everything built.

To create another Bash shell in the container for running and testing
choreographies, use the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it foo bash
```

To remove the created container, use the following command:

```bash
docker rm foo
```

### Running example choreographies

HasChor comes with a set of illustrative examples located in the `examples` directory.
Use `cabal run <executable-name>` to build and run the examples.
The executable name for each example can be found in the [`HasChor.cabal`](HasChor.cabal) file.
