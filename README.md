# HasChor

HasChor is a library for functional choreographic programming in Haskell.

- HasChor provides a monadic interface for choreographic programming where choreographies are expressed as computations in a monad.
- Based on Haskell's type system, HasChor supports *higher-order choreographies* and *location polymorphism*, both features that enable modularity and code reuse.
- HasChor's implementation is flexible, extensible, and concise (less than 300 lines of code) thanks to the mixed embedding technique it usesâ€”freer monads, which allows it to reuse existing Haskell constructs as much as possible while interpreting choreographic primitives freely.

See our [ICFP 2023 paper (preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00924) for more deatils.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

HasChor is tested with the following Haskell environment:

- [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) (9.2.6)
- [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) (3.6.2.0)

We recommend using [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) to set up the environment.

### Getting Started

*We're working on putting HasChor on Hackage.*
Right now, the easiest way to try out HasChor is to write your program inside HasChor's repo and list it as an executable in the [`HasChor.cabal`](HasChor.cabal) file.

### More Examples

HasChor comes with a set of illustrative examples located in the `examples` directory.
Use `cabal run <executable-name>` to build and run the examples.
The executable name for each example can be found in the [`HasChor.cabal`](HasChor.cabal) file.
