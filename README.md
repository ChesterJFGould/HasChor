# HasChor

HasChor is a library for functional choreographic programming in Haskell.

- HasChor provides a monadic interface for choreographic programming where
choreographies are expressed as computations in a monad.

- Based on Haskell's type system, HasChor supports *higher-order choreographies*
and *location polymorphism*, both features that enable modularity and code
reuse.

- HasChor's implementation is flexible, extensible, and concise (less than 300
lines of code) thanks to the mixed embedding technique it usesâ€”freer monads,
which allows it to reuse existing Haskell constructs as much as possible while
interpreting choreographic primitives freely.

See our [ICFP 2023 paper (preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00924) for more deatils.
For API specifications, check out the [documentation](https://gshen42.github.io/HasChor/).

HasChor's design is heavily influenced by [Pirouette](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3498684).
For a general introduction to choreographic programming, we recommend
[Fabrizio Montesi](https://www.fabriziomontesi.com)'s excellent book:

## Directory structure

- [`src`](src) is the root directory of HasChor library.
  - [`Control/Monad/Freer.hs`](src/Control/Monad/Freer.hs) defines the `Freer` monad.
  - [`Choreography.hs`](src/Choreography.hs) defines the top-level interface to the library.
  - [`Choreography/Location.hs`](src/Choreography/Location.hs) defines type-level and term-level locations: `LocTy` and `LocTm`.
  - [`Choreography/Network.hs`](src/Choreography/Network.hs) defines the `Network` monad and the `Backend` typeclass.
  - [`Choreography/Network/Local.hs`](src/Choreography/Network/Local.hs) defines the local multi-threaded backend.
  - [`Choreography/Network/Http.hs`](src/Choreography/Network/Http.hs) defines the HTTP backend.
  - [`Choreography/Choreo.hs`](src/Choreography/Choreo.hs) defines the `Choreo` monad and the `epp` funciton.
- [`examples`](examples) is the root directory of HasChor examples.
  - [`bookseller-0-network`](examples/bookseller-0-network) defines the bookseller protocol as seperate network programs.
  - [`bookseller-1-simple`](examples/bookseller-1-simple) defines the bookseller protocol as a simple choreography.
  - [`bookseller-2-higher-order`](examples/bookseller-2-higher-order) defines the bookseller protocol as a higher-ordered choreography.
  - [`kvs-1-simple`](examples/kvs-1-simple) defines a simple client-server key-value store.
  - [`kvs-2-primary`](examples/kvs-2-primary) defines a key-value store with a single backup.
  - [`kvs-3-hoc`](examples/kvs-3-hoc) defines a higher-ordered key-value store that abstracts over replication strategies.
  - [`kvs-4-location-polymorphism`](examples/kvs-4-location-polymorphism) defines a key-value store that utilizes a location-polymorphic function to support 2 backups.

## Building the library

HasChor is a Haskell library and built with the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC).
You can either [build from the source](#building-from-the-source) or [use the Docker image](#using-the-docker-image).

### Building from the source

HasChor is tested with the following Haskell environment:

- [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) (9.2.6)
- [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) (3.6.2.0)

Newer versions might work but areographical not guaranteed.
We recommend using [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) to set up the environment.

To build HasChor, do:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gshen42/HasChor.git
cd HasChor
cabal build -j20
```

### Using the Docker image

First, clone the repo and build the Docker image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gshen42/HasChor.git
cd HasChor
docker build -t haschor .
```

Next, create a container and run Bash in it:

```bash
docker run -it -name foo haschor bash
```

You should be presented with HasChor's root directory with everything built.

To create another Bash shell in the container for running and testing choreographies, do:

```bash
docker exec -it foo bash
```

To remove the created container, do:

```bash
docker rm foo
```

## Running example choreographies

HasChor comes with a set of illustrative examples located in the `examples` directory.
Use `cabal run <executable-name>` to build and run the examples.
The executable name for each example can be found in the [`HasChor.cabal`](HasChor.cabal) file.
